               <b>JavaScript</b> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated <b>JS</b>, is
               a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World
               Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use
               JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often
               incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a
               dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
          </p>
          <p>
               JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
               conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing,
               prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
               multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
               programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
               working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
               and the Document Object Model (DOM).

               The first web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was
               released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a
               prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web.[15]
               The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation,
               which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994.
               This quickly became the most-used.[16][17]
          </p>
          <p>
               During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static,
               lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in
               the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene
               to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a
               scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve
               this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming
               language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme
               language.[6]
          </p>
          <p>
               Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to
               devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme
               or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and
               its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped
               as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to
               JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][18]
          </p>
          <p>
               The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it
               is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and
               Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a
               marketing ploy by Netscape.[19]
          </p>

                 <a href="#">Edit</a>
                 <span>]</span>
               </span>
          </h3>

          <p>
               Ambitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating
               in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized
               with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.[30]
          </p>
          <p>
               The creation of Node.js in 2009 by Ryan Dahl sparked a significant
               increase in the usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Node
               combines the V8 engine, an event loop, and I/O APIs, thereby providing a
               stand-alone JavaScript runtime system.[31][32] As of 2018, Node had been
               used by millions of developers,[33] and npm had the most modules of any
               package manager in the world.[34]
          </p>
          <p>
               The ECMAScript draft specification is currently maintained openly on
               GitHub, and editions are produced via regular annual snapshots.[35]
               Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive
               proposal process.[36][37] Now, instead of edition numbers, developers
               check the status of upcoming features individually.[35]
          </p>
          <p>
               The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks,
               established programming practices, and substantial usage of JavaScript
               outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications
               and other JavaScript-heavy websites, several transpilers have been
               created to aid the development process.[38]
